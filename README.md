Human Action Recognition System

The system uses pose extraction and optical flow analysis to improve accuracy. The system is built on an LSTM model and leverages the pre-trained ResNet3D model
combined in a weighted ensemble approach. The system was tested on a dataset based on actions from UFC101 and HMDB51 and produced an accuracy of 84%.
